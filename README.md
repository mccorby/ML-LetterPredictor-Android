# ML-LetterPredictor-Android

A simple application that shows how to connect and use a TensorFlow model in an Android application.

The app relies in a model generated by TensorFlow. The machine learning project is part of the Udacity course on Deep Learning.

The model is still limited to capital letters from A to H. Soon more ;)
